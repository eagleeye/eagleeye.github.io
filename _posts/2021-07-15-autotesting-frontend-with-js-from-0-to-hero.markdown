@[Proxet Js meetup 2021](https://dou.ua/calendar/38722/)

Every product needs to be tested before release, and frontend applications are no exception. As the project grows, manual testing becomes less efficient and more time consuming. Here comes the autotests, or just tests, scripts, which automatically "click" your site, and reveal non-working functionality. We will talk about how to do it with you at the meetup. You will find both the theory of writing tests on the frontend and the practical part, where I will show how to implement it in code.
