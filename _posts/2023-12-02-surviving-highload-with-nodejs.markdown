Is Node.js suitable for highload applications? Yes! But what makes the regular Node.js application suitable for highload that will it survive 100k req/s for a reasonable price? In my talk we will go through potential bottlenecks, and how to find and fight them. What metrics can show us potential problems? How to decide, when and how we should scale our application? Also, Iâ€™ll show some interesting cases of debugging issues in real-world highload Node.js apps.
